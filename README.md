# Building-a-Deep-Convolutional-Generative-Adversarial-Network-to-Generate-Handwritten-Digits
Using Deep Learning with PyTorch 

This project implements a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate realistic-looking handwritten digits similar to those found in the MNIST dataset.

**Discriminator:** This model distinguishes between real and generated (fake) images.
**Generator:** This model generates new images that are intended to look like the real ones.

Usage
You can run the project in a Jupyter Notebook or a Python script. If using Google Colab, make sure to set up the runtime appropriately.

Tasks
Task 1: Setup Google Runtime
Ensure that your environment is set up correctly. This involves installing the required libraries, ensuring GPU support, and setting up the notebook environment.

Task 2: Configurations
Set up the configurations for your project, including hyperparameters such as batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs.

Task 3: Load MNIST Handwritten Dataset
Load the MNIST dataset, which contains 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits.

Task 4: Load Dataset into Batches
Use DataLoader to split the dataset into batches, which will be fed into the model during training.

Task 5: Create Discriminator Network
Build the discriminator network, which classifies images as real or fake.

Task 6: Create Generator Network
Build the generator network, which generates new images that attempt to pass as real ones.

Task 7: Create Loss Function and Load Optimizers
Define the loss functions for both the generator and discriminator, and set up the optimizers for training.

Task 8: Create Training Loop to Train GAN
Implement the training loop that will train the GAN. The loop will update both the discriminator and generator models iteratively.

Results
After training, the DCGAN will generate images that resemble handwritten digits. You can find the generated images in the outputs/generated_images/ directory.
